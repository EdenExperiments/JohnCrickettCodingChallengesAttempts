 🧠 JohnCrickettCodeChallenges

A collection of my personal solutions to coding challenges by [John Crickett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johncrickett/), designed to help sharpen my C# skills and problem-solving ability.

## ✍️ About This Repository

This repository contains challenge-based projects that I’ve worked through using:
- **Visual Studio 2022**
- **ReSharper** for enhanced refactoring and code analysis
- A blend of **Googling**, **AI suggestions**, and personal exploration

Each project focuses on both completing the problem and reflecting on better ways to write, structure, and test code.

## 🤖 Why I Use AI

AI (like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot) plays a support role in my workflow. I alternate between two challenge approaches:

- 🧠 Manual-first challenges – I solve these without Cursor generation, though I may still use ChatGPT to explore concepts or get refactoring suggestions after I've finished. These are about deepening my coding ability and building pattern recognition the hard way.
- ✍️ AI-assisted challenges – I use Cursor generation here to improve my prompting and code review skills. The goal is to get better at steering AI effectively and critically evaluating what it outputs.

AI is a productivity companion, will likely considerably improve in the future as it improves at keeping context of codebases with larger tokens and should be something developers learn to become more productive with.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- C# 12 / .NET 8 (min version, later project may be on .NET 10 on stable release)
- Visual Studio 2022 & Cursor (I specifically state in each readme and commits where i've used Cursor, i'm aiming to do one with and then one without, repeat)
- ReSharper
- Git & GitHub
- (Sometimes) Neovim + CLI tools for experimentation
- Long term I wish to Learn Rust + Neovim tooling and will use C# solutions as a basis to refactor into Rust Solutions for practice

## 📁 Projects Structure

Each challenge is stored in its own folder with:
- Source code
- A README (often AI-assisted) explaining the solution
- Notes on any refactors or lessons learned

## 🚧 Ongoing Goals

- Tackle all challenges in the series
- Improve code quality and architecture with each attempt
- Learn how to better *use* and *collaborate with* AI tools
- Keep experimenting with editor setups (VS, Rider, Neovim, etc.)
