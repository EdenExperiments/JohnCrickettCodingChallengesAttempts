 🧠 JohnCrickettCodeChallenges

A collection of my personal solutions to coding challenges by [John Crickett](https://johncrickett.dev/), designed to help sharpen my C# skills and problem-solving ability.

## ✍️ About This Repository

This repository contains challenge-based projects that I’ve worked through using:
- **Visual Studio 2022**
- **ReSharper** for enhanced refactoring and code analysis
- A blend of **Googling**, **AI suggestions**, and personal exploration

Each project focuses on both completing the problem and reflecting on better ways to write, structure, and test code.

## 🤖 Why I Use AI

AI (like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot) plays a support role in my process:
- ✅ Used for exploring concepts or unfamiliar patterns
- ✅ Assists with generating project README files
- ✅ Offers refactoring suggestions once a challenge is complete
- ❌ **Not** used to solve challenges directly or bypass the thinking process

The goal is to improve both my **coding ability** and **prompting skills** — I see AI as a powerful productivity companion, not a replacement for learning.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- C# 11 / .NET 8
- Visual Studio 2022
- ReSharper
- Git & GitHub
- (Sometimes) Neovim + CLI tools for experimentation
- Long term I wish to Learn Rust + Neovim tooling and will use C# solutions as a basis to refactor into Rust Solutions for practice

## 📁 Projects Structure

Each challenge is stored in its own folder with:
- Source code
- A README (often AI-assisted) explaining the solution
- Notes on any refactors or lessons learned

## 🚧 Ongoing Goals

- Tackle all challenges in the series
- Improve code quality and architecture with each attempt
- Learn how to better *use* and *collaborate with* AI tools
- Keep experimenting with editor setups (VS, Rider, Neovim, etc.)
